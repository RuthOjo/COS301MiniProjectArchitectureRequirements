This section discusses the boundaries and extent or range of view, outlook, applications, operations or effectiveness the system software architectur needs to address. 
More spesificaly we will be looking at the following three topics in depth. Persistence, Reporting and Process execution.

\subsubsection{Persistence:}
	Buzz Space needs to be percistant in order for states to be stored and outlive the many
	processes done. It will do so by making use of the following:

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Databases, to store and retrieve user accounts data and information.
			\item Java Data Objects (JDO), a specification of Java object persistence. With it's great
			 transparency feature of the persistence services to the domain model.
			\item System prevalence, a technique that joins system images and transaction journals to achieve percistancey.
		\end{itemize}
	
	
	\subsubsection{Reporting}
	\subsubsection*{Description:}
		Segregates the system into two applications, where the client makes requests to the server. In many cases, the server is a database with application logic represented as stored procedures.
			
			
	%Layered Architecture
				\subsubsection{Layered Architecture}
				\subsubsection*{Description:}
				Partitions the concerns of the application into stacked groups (layers).
