\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{Neo4j}, the preferable database technology, is schema-less, which means a schema change will not affect how the data is stored. It includes other features that would improve Buzz, but JQPL has to be used. \\ 
\item\textbf{JPQL} was chosen by the client, although Neo4j would have been better. \\ 
\item\textbf{Java EE} is the platform that will be used to implement Buzz, the system is constrained to this platform. \\ 
\item\textbf{JSF}, was chosen by the client and forms part of Java EE. \\ 
\item\textbf{AJAX} the client requested that this technology be used.  \\ 
\item\textbf{HTML} \\
\item\textbf{The operating system} that will run the Buzz server is Linux, as requested by the client.
