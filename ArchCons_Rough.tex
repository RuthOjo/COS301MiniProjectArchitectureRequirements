\subsection{Technical Constraints}
\textbf{Description:}
Technical constraints relate to the technology used to implement Buzz. Although the limiting technology can be circumvented, the limitations imposed by the technology cannot be avoided when used. \\ \\ \par
\textbf{Neo4j}, the preferable database technology, is schema-less, which means a schema change will not affect how the data is stored. It includes other features that would improve Buzz, but JQPL has to be used. \\ \par
\textbf{JPQL} was chosen by the client, although Neo4j would have been better. \\ \par
\textbf{Java EE} is the platform that will be used to implement Buzz, the system is constrained to this platform. \\ \par
\textbf{JSF}, was chosen by the client and forms part of Java EE. \\ \par
\textbf{AJAX} the client requested that this technology be used.  \\ \par
\textbf{HTML} \\ \par 
\textbf{The operating system} that will run the Buzz server is Linux, as requested by the client.
