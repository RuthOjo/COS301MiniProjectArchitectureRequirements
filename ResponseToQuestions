Good day Mrs Pieterse

My group and I just have a few BuzzSpace Architecture related questions. It would be great if you could help us in this regard.

 The questions:
 1. How many concurrent users should the system cater for ?  
Millions - Ideally Buzz should be developed to be usable in MOOCs
…

 2. Regarding how the website will be hosted
 2.1 Can we assume the service will be hosted on the same server(s) as the Cs website. 
No 
…
 2.2 Is there/does there need to be load balancing
Yes
…

 2.3 Is there/does there need to be caching of the pages
Yes
 2.4 What operating system will BuzzSpace be run on 
You should suggest an appropriate OS that is most suitable for this application - motivate your selection based on facts and not on sentiment.
…

 2.5 What version of Java / Java EE is installed / can we choose a version.
You suggest the most appropriate technology - motivate your selection based on facts and not on sentiment.
…
 1.6 What database technology is currently installed / can we choose a technology 
You suggest the most appropriate technology - motivate your selection based on facts and not on sentiment.
…
3. Should the system have redundant servers (at a different location) for/if/when the University's servers go down. 
Yes - configurable.
…

4. If the database were to go down , should the system automatically switch to a backup or redundant database connection? And how often would you like these backups to occur ? 
You have to say what you think and motivate why you think so - ideally the final users should be able to configure their preferences in this regard
…

5. Does the system need to be https enabled 
You have to say what you think and motivate why you think so - ideally the final users should be able to configure their preferences in this regard
…
6. Because this is The University of Pretoria does the design of BuzzSpace need to have multi-language support (e.g Afrikaans/English/Other) or can we assume only a English design/front end
Most development tools  allow for the development of interfaces with multi-language support. It will be a real pity if we hardcode Buzz to be only English.  
…
7. Regarding future use/maintainability of the system, will there need to be a manual of some kind or coding standards utilized during the coding process.
Stupid question - sit.--- COS301 is about teaching you the importance of these things so it goes without saying -- it is assumed.
