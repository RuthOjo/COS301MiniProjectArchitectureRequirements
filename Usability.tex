\section{Usability} \par Buzz should be easy to use and the user should be able to remember how Buzz works; despite their long absence. The interface should appear easy to use; the visuals should not frustrate the user.
This can be achieved by the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Descriptive headings that will not be ambiguous to the user.
\item Clear and descriptive "help" messages that will initiate the user into Buzz. 
\item Descriptive error messages that will tell the user an error has occurred and the necessary steps to address the errors.
\item Grouped content; this will make the interface look easier to use. If a user is looking for content, they should find related content in the same place. Navigation becomes easier.
\item A user should be given feedback on their actions. If a page is still loading, for example, the user should be aware that the page is loading.
\end{itemize} 
Usability is critical for Buzz since it's user-oriented. If users struggle to use Buzz, they will be reluctant in ever using it again.
